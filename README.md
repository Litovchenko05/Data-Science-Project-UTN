## **Data Science Course Project - "Aprende Programando" with UTN-Facultad Regional Avellaneda (2022)**

ðŸ’¡ **Project Description:**
This project aims to train machine learning models to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their technical characteristics. Using the provided data, the trained models seek to identify patterns and correlations that allow for the classification of phones into different price ranges.

ðŸ”§ **Technologies Used:**

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**

ðŸ“Š **Objective:**
The project focuses on analyzing the impact of various technical features of mobile phones, such as screen size, RAM, camera, and others, to predict the price range of each device.
